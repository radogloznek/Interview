        He was the first person that I met in the Ruby on Rails community in Melbourne. We met at Inspire9, a coworking space which is located near Melbourne CBD, at the Hack Night, one of the events which he helps to organize. Pat has been working with Ruby since 2006, and recently has been based at the coworking space of Inspire9 in Melbourne.

        He is the author of the successful gem named "Thinking Sphinx”, and of many inspiring blog posts on <a href="http://freelancing-gods.com">freelancing-gods.com</a> and so on. You will often see him travelling around the world, attending interesting events and meeting interesting people. He is a fan of bringing people together for gatherings small and large, including <a href="http://www.trampolineday.com">Trampoline</a> and <a href="http://www.railscamps.com">Rails Camp</a>. What’s more, he can also cook and prepare delicious pancakes. I have spoken to him during one of the meetings and he has agreed to this interview for Slovak Ruby community.
